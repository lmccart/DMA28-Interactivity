          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>This course is an introduction to coding within the visual arts, with a focus on interactivity. Writing code involves learning a different way of thinking and making. We will consider interactions with other people and the environment as the starting point for understanding our interactions with code. We’ll consider the roles of race, gender, sexuality, disability, and class within an increasingly software-driven world, and strategies of response as artists and designers. Can we understand software as inherently social? The ideas and skills taught in this course set a foundation that will serve as a platform for future learning within the BA program and beyond. The class is taught as a series of workshops and discussions with demonstrations and time to work.</p>
          <p>This course asks a few questions:<br>
            — How has software affected the visual arts?<br>
            — What is the potential of software within the visual arts?<br>
            — As a designer or artist, why would I want (or need) to write software?<br>
            — What are the power relationships, inequities, and biases embedded within software and technology?
          </p>
          <p>
            For this foundation we will focus on five sets of ideas:<br>
            — Instructions and Statements<br>
            — Variables and Response<br>
            — Questions and Conditionals<br>
            — Tools and Interactions<br>
            — Functions and Parameters
          </p>

          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <p>This class is built around five mini-projects, each with a media assignment (reading + videos), studio time, and a discussion about your finished project on the day that it’s due. Each project derives from the elements above. The final project will push one of the projects further. All projects will be completed in p5.js and are due at the start of class via the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXLN5RlLwsfI_OkaZacEU2LiD57Y9uxZPhonV1x0p8PnQAow/viewform" target="_blank">turn-in form</a>.</p>
          <p>Projects may be turned in up to one week late for a one letter grade deduction off the grade. Work that is more than one week late will not be accepted. If you are absent, you are expected to turn in assignments online by the deadline. It is possible that you may encounter save issues, editor or browser errors, computer crash, etc. It is highly recommended that you regularly click File > Download to save copies of your work in progress as zip files.</p>

          <h3>Expectations</h3>
          <p><span class='label'>Grading.</span> Grading is based on the projects, the final project, and active participation. Focus, articulation of ideas, keeping up with the work and assignments, and contribution to class discussions are all part of participation. All work will be evaluated based on (1) the fundamental idea you develop, (2) the way the “look and feel” of the work relates to the idea, and (3) the craft, meaning the details of the images, motion, and interaction. Outstanding work will receive As, good work will receive Bs, sufficient work that does nothing more than meet requirements will receive Cs.</p>
          <span>The numeric breakdown for all assignments follow:</span>
          <ul>
            <li>Participation 15%</li>
            <li>Project 1 12%</li>
            <li>Project 2 12%</li>
            <li>Project 3 12%</li>
            <li>Project 4 18%</li>
            <li>Final project 25%</li>
            <li>Final project documentation 6%</li>
            </ul>
          
          <p><span class='label'><a onclick='openSection("#projects")'>Projects.</a></span> Projects are due at the start of class on the date assigned via the <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXLN5RlLwsfI_OkaZacEU2LiD57Y9uxZPhonV1x0p8PnQAow/viewform'>turn-in form</a>. Projects may be turned in up to one week late for a one letter grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than one week late will not be accepted. If you are absent, you are still expected to turn in projects online by the deadline. Extra time will not be given for work lost due to save issues, editor or browser errors, computer crash, etc. You should regularly click File > Download to save a copies of your work in progress as zip files. It would also be wise to make a backup of these online or on an external harddrive or USB stick in case your computer is lost.</p>

          <p><span class='label'>Media.</span> Each project will be accompanied by a collection of readings, videos, and other media to look at. You are expected to read/watch/consume each item listed. Doing so will make this class much easier and more enjoyable. If it is clear you are not doing this work, your project grades will lower. All of the assigned readings from the course will be from <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-p5-js-Interactive-JavaScript-dp-1457186772/dp/1457186772/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=' target='_blank'>Getting Started with p5.js</a> or located online, you will need to purchase this textbook.</p>

          <p><span class='label'>Participation.</span> Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class. Do the work, share your thoughts, ask questions, prepare for meetings, offer feedback during critiques. This class is meant to be a safe space in which you feel encouraged and supported in learning and taking creative risks. This means being aware and considerate of different backgrounds, perspectives, and identities. Respect each other and this space we are building together. Don’t assume, ask. Remain open, be willing to take responsibility, apologize, and learn. Help each other in this. If there are concerns please let me or Chelly know as soon as possible.</p>
          
          <p><span class='label'>Attendance.</span> I have the strong expectation that you will join for each class and workshop session, but I won’t be keeping a scored attendance record this quarter. If something happens and you can't join the class, please email me. If you feel frustrated or you come across other problems, please communicate with me directly and quickly.</p>

          <h3>Commitment to Diversity and Safer Spaces</h3>
          <p>We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students, TA, and instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor or TA.

            <h4>Description</h4>
            Part 1 due 1/17:
              <ul>
                <li>Spend some time looking at instructions or guides for using various technologies. This might mean a setup guide for a piece of technology, cooking instructions, a TikTok video giving advice, an assembly instructions for Ikea furniture, etc. Think broadly about the terms “technology” and “instructions”. 
                  Select one and add a slide to our <a href='https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uJy8lSTj_i2efkIHMX7P2O6HANQMUNm8MzaWnH7_h-Y/edit?usp=sharing' target="_blank">class instruction deck</a>. The slide could be an image, text, or whatever you like to represent the instructions.
                  We will popcorn around and you will have ~20 seconds to explain your instruction set.</li>
                  <li>Bring three objects that are encoded with meaning for you. 
                    Consider: Does the object function as a tool, a guide, or something else? 
                    How is its purpose embedded in and shaped by the form? What other meaning is encoded in the object? 
                    How do you typically interact with these objects?</li>
              </ul>
            Part 2 due 1/22:
            <ul>
              <li>
                From the collective still life we assemble in class, select a portion to draw using p5.js. Focus on the drawing Functions introduced in class and in the media for this week.
                Turn your project in via the <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXLN5RlLwsfI_OkaZacEU2LiD57Y9uxZPhonV1x0p8PnQAow/viewform'>projects form</a> by 2pm on 1/22. Come prepared to share in class.</li>

              <ul><li>
                Write or select a short text (one paragraph or less) that you will read/perform for the class with a mask you create in code.
                It could be a manifesto for your practice, a monologue for a character or element in a piece, a rant, a poem, a set of instructions, or anything else. 
              </li></ul>
              Part 2 due 1/29: 
              <ul><li>
               Based on the text, create an audioreactive piece that you will use to perform the text. 
                Using the <a href='https://editor.p5js.org/lmccart/sketches/thuaoBZ7_' target="_blank">provided code template</a>, make your mask react to audio, changing as the volume of your voice changes. 
                This project will be evaluated based on how the mask relates to the text, the variation of the mask (how much is changes), the design of the mask, and your performance of it.
                Turn your project in via the <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXLN5RlLwsfI_OkaZacEU2LiD57Y9uxZPhonV1x0p8PnQAow/viewform'>turn-in form</a> by 2pm on 1/29. 
                Include the text to be performed as a comment at the top of the code. You will perform your mask in class. 
                Rehearse your text performance ahead of time, modulating the volume of your voice as needed to control the mask.

            <h4>Description</h4>

            <p>There's a long history of writing software to draw on computers. From the light pen, to the mouse, to touch screens, some of these programs are basic and some are bursting with features; some are serious and others are whimsical; some are general and others are as unique as the individual who wrote them. This project has three parts. You will make a separate sketch for each part of the project, the canvas for each sketch should be 600 x 600 pixels.</p>

            Part 1 due 2/12:
            <ul>
              <li>Use the mouseX, mouseY, and mouseIsPressed variables in a program to make the simplest drawing program you can imagine, but with a slight twist.</li>
            </ul>

            Part 2 due 2/14:
            <ul>
              <li>Start with your code from Part A and add the keyPressed() event function to clear the screen with a different color when each of the keys 1-5 is pressed. Select your colors thoughtfully and carefully.</li>
              <li>Bring notes and sketches for your final drawing tool to class.</li>
            </ul>

            Part 3 due 2/21:
              <ul>
                <li>Write a drawing program in the tradition of <a href='https://jamesfriend.com.au/pce-js/' target='_blank'>Kid Pix</a>. Include, at the minimum, at least two different tools for making marks and two other features. Create an interface to select which tool to draw with, by creating buttons and/or by using the keyboard. Have a clear point of view about drawing that is expressed through the design of your program. How is your drawing program unique and what is it for? Write a detailed comment at the top of the code that explains the core idea of the software.
                  Enter the link for each part of the project into the <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXLN5RlLwsfI_OkaZacEU2LiD57Y9uxZPhonV1x0p8PnQAow/viewform'>turn-in form</a> by 2pm on 2/21. Come prepared to share in class.</li>

            <h4>Description</h4>

            <p>Working in partners, make a work that is collectively created in some way. This may be an installation that different people interact and contribute to.
              It may be something created by media or text collectively sourced. Or anything else you can imagine. The result should be a dynamically
              evolving visual, textual, sonic, or performative artifcat that develops from a novel interaction betwen friends, siblings, collaborators,
              neighbors, or strangers. Carefully consider the kinds of actions or authorship you hope to elicit, and how the interaction design of
              your system influences individual (and hence collective) behavior. Paradoxically, the tightest constraints can often produce the most
              interesting results. Can you create the conditions for unexpected emergent behaviors to arise? 
              <b>Use at least one function that you define yourself in your code.</b>
            </p>
